    "p-2": "After graduating, I travelled and worked in different countries for several years, which allowed me to gain new perspectives and improve my language skills. I spent over two years in Vancouver, Canada, working in engineering and improving my English. Later I worked in Germany, which also gave me a basic understanding of German. Apart from that, I have travelled around Asia (Bali, Cambodia, Bangkok, Singapore) and Hawaii.",
    "p-3": "My desire to create and solve problems led me to programming. I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and later focused on Next.js and backend technologies. I have experience with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) as well as modern approaches such as Server Actions, Prisma ORM and serverless databases.",
    "p-4": "My greatest asset is my ability to learn new technologies and put them into practice quickly. Although I don't have a formal IT background, I believe that my practical experience, determination and adaptability will lead me to be a strong developer on any team."
