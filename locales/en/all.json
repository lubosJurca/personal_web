    "p-1": "I am a dedicated self-taught developer who is learning new technologies every day to become an IT developer. My goal is not driven by financial reasons - I have a wealth of experience in my current field and the ability to hold a steady job. Still, programming has intrigued me enough that I see my future in it.",
    "p-2": "After graduating from high school, I decided to travel and discover new cultures and myself. I spent over two years in Vancouver, Canada, working in engineering without my compatriots, which helped me improve my English. Later I also worked in Germany, which gave me a foundation in German. Apart from that, I travelled around Asia, visiting Bali, Cambodia, Bangkok and Singapore, and I also visited Hawaii.  Travelling has enriched me with new experiences and world views.",
    "p-3": "My passion for problem solving led me to programming. I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and then moved on to Next.js and backend technologies through the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I can design a simple backend and connect it to a database, allowing me to create fully functional web applications.",
    "p-4": "On my own project I show what I have learned so far - from the user interface to working with data on the server. My desire to constantly improve and discover new technologies is my greatest strength. Although I don't have a formal IT background, I believe that my practical experience, language skills and strong motivation can develop me quickly under the right guidance. I am ready to bring value to any team I work with."
